Q1)DiscountCalculator Using Setter Injection in Spring
You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that calculates discounts based on a product's price and the day of the week 
using setter-based dependency injection. The discount rate will change based on whether it's a weekday or weekend.

Requirements:
DiscountCalculator Class:
Create a DiscountCalculator class with the following attributes:
LocalDate currentDate: This will store the current date.
double price: This will store the product price.
Implement setter methods for currentDate and price to allow for dependency injection using Spring.
Implement a calculateDiscount() method that returns:
A 10% discount if the day is a weekday (Monday to Friday).
A 20% discount if the day is a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).

Note:
------
Use Xml file to configure Spring bean.


Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the DiscountCalculator bean, and prints the 
discounted price based on the day of the week.

Expected Output:
If the current day is a weekday (e.g., Tuesday) and the price is 100:
	Discounted Price: 90.0 (10% discount applied)

If the current day is a weekend (e.g., Saturday) and the price is 100:
	Discounted Price: 80.0 (20% discount applied)
