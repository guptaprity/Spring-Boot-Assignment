✅ Task 1: Weather-Based Outfit Suggester
Scenario:
You're building a Spring Core application that suggests what to wear based on the weather temperature. Use constructor-based injection to provide the temperature.

🧩 Requirements:
OutfitSuggester Class:

int temperature: injected via constructor.

Method: suggestOutfit()

< 10°C → "Wear a heavy jacket"

10–20°C → "Wear a sweater"

> 20°C → "Wear light clothes"

XML Configuration:
Inject the temperature value using XML.

Main Class:
Load the context, get the bean, and print the suggested outfit.

🎯 Learning Highlights:
Constructor Injection with primitive values.

Spring XML config + conditional logic.


✅ Task 2: Movie Ticket Pricing Based on Age
Scenario:
Create a Spring Core app that calculates the ticket price based on the user’s age using constructor injection.

🧩 Requirements:
TicketPriceCalculator Class:

int age: injected via constructor.

Method: calculatePrice():

< 12 → ₹100

12–60 → ₹200

> 60 → ₹150

XML Configuration:
Inject age value in XML file.

Main Class:
Load context and display ticket price.

🎯 Learning Highlights:
Use of constructor injection with XML.

Simple age-based pricing strategy logic.

✅ Task 3: Electricity Bill Calculator (Units-Based)
Scenario:
Design a Spring Core application to calculate the electricity bill based on units consumed, using constructor injection.

🧩 Requirements:
ElectricityBillCalculator Class:

int units: injected via constructor.

Method: calculateBill():

0–100 units → ₹1.5/unit

101–300 units → ₹2.5/unit

> 300 units → ₹4/unit

XML Configuration:
Inject units via XML.

Main Class:
Load context, get the bean, and print the bill amount.

🎯 Learning Highlights:
Constructor-based numeric logic.

Practical use-case in utilities.


✅ Task 4: Mobile Data Usage Bill Calculator

Scenario:
A telecom company wants to calculate monthly charges based on data used (in GB).
Use setter injection to inject data usage.

Requirements

Class: DataUsageCalculator
Field: double dataUsed (in GB) — inject using setter

Method: calculateCharges()
Billing Logic:

Data Range	Rate
0–2 GB	Free
2–10 GB	₹20 per GB
>10 GB	₹50 per GB

XML: inject dataUsed.

Main: Load context, get bean, print charge.

✅ Task 5: Vehicle Mileage Efficiency Evaluator

Scenario:
A transport company wants to check the mileage status of a vehicle based on fuel consumed.

Requirements

Class: MileageEvaluator
Fields (setter injection):

double distance (km)

double fuelUsed (liters)

Method: getMileageStatus()
Logic:

Calculate mileage → distance / fuelUsed

Categorize:

Mileage	Category
< 10 km/l	Poor
10–18 km/l	Average
> 18 km/l	Excellent

XML: inject distance & fuelUsed values.

Main: print mileage & category.

✅ Task 6: Income Tax Calculator (Simple Slab System)

Scenario:
Create a Spring Core app to calculate tax based on annual income using setter injection.

Requirements

Class: IncomeTaxCalculator
Field: double annualIncome — inject using setter.

Method: calculateTax()
Logic:

Income Range	Tax Rate
0–2.5 L	No Tax
2.5–5 L	5%
5–10 L	20%
>10 L	30%

XML: inject the income value.
Main: load bean & print tax amount.
