## 🔹 Project Overview

This repository contains a **Spring Boot assignment** focused on demonstrating **Dependency Injection (DI)** using **Setter Injection**.  
It is designed to showcase how Spring’s **IoC (Inversion of Control) container** manages objects and injects dependencies at runtime.

The main use case implemented is an **Electricity Bill Generator**, which calculates the total bill based on:

- Units consumed  
- Rate per unit

## 🔹 Key Features

- Demonstrates **Setter Injection** in Spring Boot  
- Modular, loosely-coupled code using Spring IoC  
- XML-based configuration for injecting property values  
- Easy-to-understand example of real-world application
